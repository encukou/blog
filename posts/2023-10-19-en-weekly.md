<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Is this thing still on?

Let me try to restart weekly notes about what I've been up to.
In the beginning, a lot of context will be missing...

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Last week, I organized the CPython core developer sprint in Brno.
That should get its own blog post...

On Monday, I stayed offline after the busy week.

Tuesday, I started on reading all the emails from last week.
With various interruptions, that took me two days.

Tuesday's [freezeyt stream](https://youtube.com/live/H_8AKmB6c_0?feature=share)
went nicely; with an overview of `contextlib.ExitStack`, and more time spent
adding static typing information.
I still don't know if I want to add the types.

For work, I got to port a security fix to Python 2.6.
Yup, 2.6 is still supported!

Thursday, I paid the administrative fee required to legally
do contract work.
Hopefully, the paperwork will be done soon.
