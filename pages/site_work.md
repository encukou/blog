Title: I work

Currently, I work at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com),
leading the Python Maintenance team.
We integrate Python with [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) and
[RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux).

Previously I worked on [FreeIPA](s),
which involved fighting [mutant dogs from the underworld](http://kerberos.org/software),
a hipster [NoSQL database](https://directory.fedoraproject.org) (which was cool *way* before NoSQL was cool),
and a [certificate system](https://pki.fedoraproject.org).

These pages contain my opinions, not necessarily my employers'.
