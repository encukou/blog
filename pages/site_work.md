Title: I work

Currently, I work at [Red Hat](http://redhat.com),
leading the Python Maintenance team.

A lot of my work is for [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), for example
I maintain [PortingDB](http://fedora.portingdb.xyz/) which tracks
progress of porting all Python packages in Fedora to Python 3.

Previously I worked on [FreeIPA](http://www.freeipa.org),
which involved fighting [mutant dogs from the underworld](http://kerberos.org/software),
a hipster [NoSQL database](http://directory.fedoraproject.org) (which was cool *way* before NoSQL was cool),
and a [certificate system](http://pki.fedoraproject.org).
