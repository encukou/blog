Title: I talk

I also share my knowledge in various presentations.
Most of my talks happen at meetups of the
[Python users group](http://python.cz) in Brno,
which I help organize.
I also design and teach community programming courses.

Some of my talks can be found on [YouTube][playlist]
and I tend to put put slides/materials on [GitHub].
Unfortunately, a lot of my talks have been slide-less lately,
and good recordings aren't that easy to make.
You shold come in person!
