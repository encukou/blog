&lt;p&gt;We have lost a humble genius, a mathematician, an architect of the abstract.
It's sad that most poeple will never be able to appreciate the beauty of things
he has done.

on some of his work; you should read it if you haven't done so already.

&lt;p&gt;Dr Ritchie likes to emphasise that he was just one member of a&amp;nbsp;group.
With characteristic modesty, he suggests that many of the improvements he
introduced when developing C simply “looked like a&amp;nbsp;good thing to do”.
Anyone else in the same place at the same time, he implies, would have done
the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, he Did the Right Thing; he found the answer that is, in
retrospect, obvious. That is the mark of a&amp;nbsp;genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His ideas stood the test of time. He has reached a&amp;nbsp;local maximum: Java or C++
or C# are object-oriented languages; C is the procedural language. Sure, there
may be something better than C, in some sense of the word.
It's&amp;nbsp;like Newton's&amp;nbsp;laws being surpassed by Einstein's&amp;nbsp;relativity – C will still
be there.
Still valid, still useful, still&amp;nbsp;used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have lost a&amp;nbsp;humble genius, a&amp;nbsp;mathematician, an architect of the abstract.

he has done.
